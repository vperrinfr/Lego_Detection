# Lego Detection with Watson Visual Recognition

Today, **Watson Visual Recognition Custom Object Detection** feature allows clients to train Watson by labelling specific objects, and training Watson to identify those objects in other images as well. For instance, clients can train Watson to determine the type of vehicle damage inside an image, including the location of the damage and the relative size of the damage. This results in more refined accuracy of the data overall, which helps to predict future outcomes, including estimated cost of repair from the vehicle damage.

In this repository, I have published pictures to be able to train and test the custom object detection model. I have also published annotations in JSON and XML (PASCAL VOC - Visual Object Classes).
